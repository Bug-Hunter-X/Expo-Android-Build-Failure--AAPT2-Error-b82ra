The solution depends on the root cause.  Common causes include:
1. **Duplicate resource IDs or names**: Check your project for any duplicate images, layouts, or other resources with the same name or ID.  Use Android Studio or a similar tool to identify conflicts.
2. **Invalid resource declarations**: Verify all your resource files (XML, images, etc.) are correctly formatted and valid.  Look for typos or missing attributes.
3. **Incorrect image formats**: Ensure all images used are in supported formats (png, jpg, etc.) and are appropriately sized.
4. **Missing or corrupt resources**: Check for any missing or corrupted resources in your project. Re-download them if necessary. 
5. **Build cache issues**: Try clearing the Expo cache using `expo start --clear`. 
6. **Gradle issues**: In rare cases, Gradle configuration might be the culprit. Update to the latest Gradle version and ensure your `build.gradle` file is correctly configured.
